                Agent: Your persona lacks uniqueness, and your content needs a compelling story.<br>
                You: But I've been trying so hard.<br>
                Agent: I know, but sometimes, we need a fresh perspective. How about learning from the best?<br>
                You: Learn from who?<br>
                Agent: You know Ava, our company's top influencer? You should DM her for advice.<br>

                You: I've been thinking about it, but I'm not sure where to start.<br>

                through a breakup have a boyfriend.<br>
                You: Is this really a good idea? Won't we get caught for faking it?<br>
